# Tutorial app for Android Two-Way Binding
## Overview
This is an Android Java app with the purpose to demonstrate how Android two-way data binding can be implemented.
It uses the standard Android data binding library, not a third party library like 'ButterKnife'.

##

## Usage
When you launch the app, you see two sections, populated with dummy data:
1. An Employee detail information section and
2. A list of Employees

The data from the currently selected employee is bound to the employee detail section.
When you update data like the employee name in the detail section and save it, it automatically updates the list view.

## Tutorial
This project can be used in combination with my blog tutorial on Android two-way data binding
