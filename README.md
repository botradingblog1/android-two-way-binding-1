# Tutorial app for Android Two-Way Binding
## Overview
The purpose or this project is to demonstrate how Android two-way data binding can be implemented using standard Android SDK functionality.
It uses the Android data binding library, not a third party library like 'ButterKnife'.

The project was intended for my [blog post on Android two-way data binding](http://justmobiledev.com/android-two-way-binding-with-viewmodels/).

The Android documentation on [two-way data binding](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/data-binding/two-way) and [ViewModels](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel) is a good read to better understand the project.

## Getting Started
Open the Android project file in Android Studio or Eclipse with Android Development Tools. Then clean, build and run on a device or emulator.

## Prerequisites
Android Studio or Eclipse with Android Development Tools.

## Building
1. Open the project in Android Studio or Eclipse
2. Clean and build the project
3. Use the 'Play' (>) button to launch the app on a device or emulator

## Installing & Deployment
1. You can run the app in an Android emulator from Android Studio or
2. You can connect a Developer Mode enabled Android device via USB cable to your computer and run the app on the device.

## Usage
When you launch the app, you see two sections, populated with dummy data:
1. An employee detail information section and
2. A list of employees

The data from the currently selected employee is bound to the employee detail section.
When you update data like the employee name in the detail section and save it, it automatically updates the list view.

## Implementation
* The app uses Android data binding, which is enabled in the app build.gradle.
* The employee detail view uses the EmployeeDetailViewModel, which is bound to the view (fragment_employee_detail) using MutableLiveData to sync the employee properties.
* The employee list consists of a RecyclerView, which is populated via the EmployeeListAdapter class.
* When an employee is selected from the list, the onItemClick event is triggered, which uses a callback to the presenter to load the selected employee into the ViewModel.
* The dummy data is generated by a third party library, which is added in the build gradle: 'compile 'org.fluttercode.datafactory:datafactory:0.8
