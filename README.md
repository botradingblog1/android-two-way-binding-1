# Tutorial app for Android Two-Way Binding
## Overview
This is an Android Java app with the purpose to demonstrate how Android two-way data binding can be implemented.
It uses the standard Android data binding library, not a third party library like 'ButterKnife'.

The Android documentation on [two-way data binding](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/data-binding/two-way) and [ViewModels](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel) is a good read to better understand the project.

## Tutorial
This project can be used in combination with my blog tutorial on Android two-way data binding
[here](http://justmobiledev.com/android-two-way-binding-with-viewmodels/).

## Implementation
* The app uses Android data binding, which is enabled in the app build.gradle.
* The employee detail view uses the EmployeeDetailViewModel, which is bound to the view (fragment_employee_detail) using MutableLiveData to sync the employee properties.
* The employee list consists of a RecyclerView, which is populated via the EmployeeListAdapter class.
* When an employee is selected from the list, the onItemClick event is triggered, which uses a callback to the presenter to load the selected employee into the ViewModel.
* The dummy data is generated by a third party library, which is added in the build gradle: 'compile 'org.fluttercode.datafactory:datafactory:0.8

## Usage
When you launch the app, you see two sections, populated with dummy data:
1. An employee detail information section and
2. A list of employees

The data from the currently selected employee is bound to the employee detail section.
When you update data like the employee name in the detail section and save it, it automatically updates the list view.
